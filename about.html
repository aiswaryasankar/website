Hi! I'm a software engineer at Uber Freight. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019 where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
<br><br>
I like computer science. 
<br>
Last summer I got to work on the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/home/make-storytime-more-magical-google-home-and-disney/"> storybook feature</a> newly released for Google Assistant.
For two summers before that I helped optimize the <a href="https://github.com/aiswaryasankar/IntelMachineLearning/blob/master/FinalNotebook.ipynb">register file design verification process</a> at Intel.

I really enjoy playing tennis. 
<br>
For the four years of my time at Cal I greatly enjoyed playing for the <a href="http://californiaclubtennis.com/">Cal Club Tennis team</a>.  We placed second at Nationals last year and competed each of the last four years! Go Bears!!
