ok so I really have to do deliberate practice here. It is important. Also these guys are trolls. Maybe later in life you can 
consider playing with them if they are actually any good. But not right now and definitely not over the summer. You need 
someone who will actually take you seriously. Brijen is definitely very good for you. Be completely open with him. Ask him
for help when and if you need it. He is not fabricating anything other than being busy I think. He wants to get to a point
where he thinks he can ask you out before getting any emotions evolved in this entire process. That is how I was earlier on as 
well so I should completely respect that. It is not like I did not go home before or that I did not say I have other things
to do when he asked earlier.
