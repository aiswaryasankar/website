Hi! I'm a senior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
<br><br>
I'm a computer science enthusiast. 
<br>
Last summer I got to work on adding lighting effects and dialog flows to the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/home/make-storytime-more-magical-google-home-and-disney/"> storybook feature</a> newly released for Google Assistant.
For two summers before that I got to help optimize the <a href="https://github.com/aiswaryasankar/IntelMachineLearning/blob/master/FinalNotebook.ipynb">register file design verification process</a> at Intel. 
Prior to that I worked on Android development at <a href="http://peel.com/">Peel Technologies</a>.

<br>
I'm a tennis player and I enjoy sports. 
<br>
For the four years of my time here at Cal I've greatly enjoyed playing for the <a href="http://californiaclubtennis.com/">Cal Club Tennis team</a>. We've made it to Nationals each of the last three years so far! Go Bears!
