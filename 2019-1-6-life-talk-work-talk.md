At any given time there are generally 2 different conversations going on in lab - one about work and another about life. The rate at which people join the conversation about work can be modeled as a Poisson arrival process with mean 2 per minute and the conversation about life as a Poisson mean 3 per minute. On a particular evening there are 8 people not doing jack and talking in lab. What's the probability that there's one solitary person trying to get everyone to talk about work?
