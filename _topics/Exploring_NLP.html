A huge portion of the knowledge in the world is represented and stored through text.  Thus a huge part of being able to learn to understand the world comes from being able to understand, generate and process these textual transfers of information.  With this lens in mind, very excited to have taken Stanford's NLP and NLU courses and to experiment on things myself.  These articles aim to cover topics in improving our understanding of natural language!
