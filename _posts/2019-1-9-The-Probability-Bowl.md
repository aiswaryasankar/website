The EECS + Math departments decide its time to hold a competition to see who knows their probability chops the best. Exciting!! The first round is divided into 3 groups. The top 3 finishers in each group are awarded finalist medals - the top finisher moves on to the final round. The final round consists of one 'Problem of the Gods'. The time it takes you to finish the problem (if you can) determines the winners.  Two of my friends and I are jokesters and make a bet that we'll sweep the competition placing 1st, 2nd and 3rd in a certain order. Can we compute the probability that we do?
