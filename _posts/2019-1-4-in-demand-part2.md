We've left the alternate universe and entered my dreams. In my dreams there are not just 2 people who have something to ask me, but an entire line of people! The room I'm in can only hold n people max. Also let's say that it now takes me 5 minutes to answer each question and that a new person joins the line every 8 minutes. I want to answer every question in my dream before I wake up. How long can I expect it to take before I answer the nth person's question?
