I was sitting on the patient bed, feet dangling down, my poker face nicely assembled.  My doctor was sitting not far from me having just wheeled away from touching around on my right foot.  She had spoken a bit, I had replied to some quesitons.  Most of it was inconsequential, and passed over me until she mentioned 'Osteonecrosis'. 
<br>

I had long come to the internal agreement that whenever I sat in a doctor's room I would be completely expresionless as I found that to be the best way to show the detachment and absolute lack of power I had over the situation.  There was nothing I could do about my condition so I might as well act like it didn't concern me.  My brain though was whirling.  'Osteonecrosis' struck me.  "Osteo' was definitely 'bone' simple enough.  Now 'necrosis'.  The only thing that could be was something along the lines of 'necromancer', dark, evil.  I was busy coming up with different manipulations of the phrase when my doctor broke in and gave some further explanation probably on the request of my mother sitting on the stool in the corner of the room.  
    
​     "Bone death." Wasn't too far off I determined, there couldn't be much more evil or dark things that could happen to a bone after all.  Soon though after I'd finished reasoning through this to myself, lauding myself on my word dissection skills my brain shut off. 'Bone death'.  I didn't get to much more thinking past that.
     
<br>
At home that day though, things kicked back in.  <b><i><a href="/medical-markov.md">What were the odds that I actually had Osteonecrosis??</a></i></b>

<br>
Well first, a little background as to how I came to find myself in this situation.  The entire ordeal had at this point started three months ago when my mom had noticed me slightly limping on my way out the door.  I'd convinced myself I'd just stubbed my toe - at times it would bother me when I walked a certain way but nothing much of concern really.  Nothing to keep me off the tennis court at least.  As a long time competitive tennis player I wasn't ready to let anything keep me from training.  Thus I was determined to pass it off as nothing, yet it was my mom that day who ended up being right.  A few days after my mom pointed this out, I took an X-ray and my doctor posed I might have a hairline fracture in this small bone under my toe, the sesamoid.  Initially I was asked to take a week of rest - now three months later I was at home contemplating Osteonecrosis.

<br>

I've always loved to have a logical hat on.  My doctor's posing of the term may have been vague - something perhaps just to foreshadow a potential future - yet I wanted to know more.  I was healthy, had high calcium levels, exercised rigorously.  I was 16, of Indian ethnicity, a healthy eater.  <b><i>Could I somehow take all of these factors into play and determine a numeric probability that I had osteonecrosis? </i></b>

<br>

My doctor had no such probability for me, yet she did say that due to my youth, exercise, other factors, and perhaps for reassurance purposes, that the chance I had osteonecrosis was small.  That hardly satisfied me yet there was only one way to know for sure - an MRI.  Black bone meant dead bone, white bone meant alive bone.  Yet MRIs were expensive.  At that point there was very little I wanted than to know for sure whether this osteonecrosis thing was real or not so price didn't bother me.  However she did have a point.  Why would I take such an expensive test if I had a microscopically small chance of testing positive?  I needed to prove my hunch that I really needed that test.  <b><i>How could I show that the information I would gain from performing the MRI outweighed the cost?</i></b>

<br>

Now at the time I had no way of showing this and my doctor had determined for me that it would be better to wait on the MRI.  Instead she suggested this incredible 'experimental bone regrowth ultrasound'.  Essentially every day for the next two months I would apply this paste to the region below my bone and then strap on an ultrasound device to the bottom of my foot for half an hour. So thus every day for the next two months, the interval between the first mention of 'osteonecrosis' and my next check up, I dutifully underwent 'experimental bone regrowth ultrasound'.  
<br>

The next check up finally came.  Once again I sat up on the hospital bed, poker face assembled as my doctor felt around the bottom of my foot.  This time I couldn't hide my grimace of pain.  I didn't care that the experimental therapy hadn't worked much - it was experimental after all and if my case ended up gaining data for someone else's experiment and it helped, fine.  Yet for me to waste two months on this?!  Couldn't we have figured out sooner that this wasn't working? Did I have to be completely in the dark? <b><i>Wasn't there any way I could have gotten some information, perhaps inaccurate, every day to get an idea if my bone was deteriorating or healing as I waited?</i></b>
​      
<br>

As my doctor rolled back after seeing my first grimace on the hospital bed, she determined it was finally time for me to get that MRI.  This level of pain put me at a significantly higher chance of having osteonecrosis.  The week after my checkup I had the $1000 plus dollar scan prescribed to me. Black and white, bone death couldn't have been any clearer as my doctor and I panned around the 3-d scan.  There was a perfect, black round sphere in the middle of all the other pristine glassy white bones of my foot.  

<br>

At this point, there was no longer much of an alternative.  Five months after that day I had fiercely denied to my mother that anything could possibly be the matter with my foot, I was on my way to the surgery room.  Ultimately I couldn't have been more fortunate that the surgery to have the bone removed - a sesamoidectomy - was successful.  Four months later with the help of my surgery team, physical therapists, my parents, my doctor, and God I was all good once again.

<br>

Yet ultimately, though I may still remain stoic about the ordeal over which I had little if any involvment, my logical brain is still ablaze.  The entire world of medicine, with all the patients in the world and over all these years of advancements, has so much information about similar patients with similar situations.  With all this information, couldn't I have avoided all this waiting in the first place? <b><i>How could I designed a better treatment from the very start?</i></b>
