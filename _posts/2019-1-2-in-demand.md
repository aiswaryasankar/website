In an alternate universe, I get to answer questions about reinforcement learning! Wow! Let's say there are 2 people who want to ask me something. The time I take to answer a qeustion can be modeled as an exponential random variable with mean 10 minutes. One person asks a question 5 minutes before the other. How long can I expect to be in the limelight answering questions?
