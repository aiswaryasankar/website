Who needs hobbies when you can do research all day? :) Unfortunately, perhaps, we aren't machines and desire to explore other things. There are a lot of different things I want to try out; ultimately I want to stick with the one I enjoy the most and am relatively good at.I decide to pick up a new hobby whenever I meet someone interested in it. Let's say I can model the times I meet interesting new people as a poisson arrival process with rate 3 months. I need to branch out so whenever I meet a new person, I decide to commit to learning that hobby. Let's also say that the time I spend on each hobby can be modeled as a random variable mean 5 hours a week, 20 hours a month. By the end of 2 years how much research time has been taken up by hobby exploring?
